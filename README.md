This repository contains the source code for a workshop on how to build Bitcoin wallets on Android using the [bitcoindevkit](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit). The workshop is a 1-day walkthrough of the codebase and building of the wallet, and comes with a webpage tutorial breaking the journey into 10 distinct tasks. [Check out the website here](https://thunderbiscuit.github.io/summerofbitcoin-wallet/).

The wallet is purposely light on Android-specific features, aiming to keep the focus on bitcoin integration with the application as well as the bitcoindevkit API.

### Bitcoindevkit
The bitcoindevkit project is much more than an Android library. A modern kit to help developers build bitcoin wallets, it's a [Rust library](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk) with language bindings for [Android and JVM](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk-jni), and a [cli](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk-cli) tool to boot! If you'd like to learn more or contribute, check out the [official website](https://bitcoindevkit.org/) or join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/d7NkDKm).
